# title-replacer-action

> Replaces, formats or removes keywords in titles of issues and PRs.


## Examples

Enforce a format for certain words:


```diff
- "monorepo-package" SyntaxError: üçÑ not allowed here
+ `monorepo-package` - SyntaxError: üçÑ not allowed here
```

Auto-fix common misspellings

```diff
- RGBA colours are not supported
+ RGBA colors are not supported
```

Ensure your brand is untarnished by lowercaseness:

```diff
- Lost all files due to steam
+ Lost all files due to Steam
```
